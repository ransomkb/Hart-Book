				<h3 class="main">Kids love learning fun things</h3>
				<p class="main">Looking around for more enjoyable things to teach our students, we saw a desire and demand among kids and their parents for classes about computers and the internet. Thus, the Computer Science course was born. </p>
				
				<h4 class="main">Beginning Course</h4>
				<p class="main">We offer a beginning class that teaches students how to create simple home-pages and web-sites on the internet. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through apps on iPads gives them the skills to build their own sites. They also learn a bit about creating images and graphics-design. These skills prepare them for more serious programming in the Intermediate course.</p>
				
				<h4 class="main">Intermediate Course</h4>
				<p class="main">At the intermediate level, kids learn how to program by building some simple games. Using an easy to use and learn programming language called Lua, they craft various games that teach them concepts such as positioning, "if... then..." statements, and functions. By the end of the course, the kids are able to combine all this knowledge and more to create interesting and entertaining applications.</p>
				<p class="main">Computer skills in web-site design and application creation build a strong foundation for a child's future, providing practical life-skills, becoming an interesting hobby, or even leading to a lucrative job in IT.</p>
